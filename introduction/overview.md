# Overview

Here is a quick synopsis of how ColdBox Relax works.

# Capabilities

So what can you do with Relax?

* Define your ReSTful services via our awesome Relax DSL (Programmatic or Implicit)
* Generate ColdBox Routes from described ReSTful routes
* Using this DSL we will document your entire ReSTful web service and you will be able to export the documentation in the following formats: 
    * HTML
    * PDF
    * Trac Wiki Markup
    * Mediawiki Wiki Markup (CodexWiki)
* Using the DSL you will also have access to our RelaxURL (pronounced "Relaxer") tool, from which you can test your ReSTful web services
* Use the RelaxURL tool to test against ANY ReSTful service
* Keep a history of your latest Relaxed test requests so you can rebuild your request and test again
* LogBox integration so you can use the RelaxLogs viewer to monitor and see your log db entries
* Programmatic DSL for configuration of your RESTful services
